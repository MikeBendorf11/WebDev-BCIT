            meta-site, co-designing the navigation bar and lecture side-menu. In addition, he created mock-ups prior to
            implementation and focused mainly on the Home site.</p>

                Developer Certificate at BCIT and become a Web Developer. In this project I collaborated with the navigation bar, responsive design and the <a href="../group_project/quiz.html">quiz</a> page</p>

        <h1 class="oswald">WHAT'S NEW?</h1>
        <ol class="helvetica">

            <li>1. Cleaner, minimalist and streamlined layout that is easier to use</li>
            <li>2. A layout that makes accessing different pages of the site fast (fixed navigation bar and
            side menu for lectures)</li>
            <li>3. Responsive layout for all screens, including mobile</li>
            <li>4. Fluid arrangements of site components and colors</li>
            <li>5. Made most popular parts of the site the easiest to access</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="helvetica">&emsp;For the new design, we have completely stripped previous constructs and rebuilt a layout
        with efficient and streamlined user experience as the main priority. On the home page, we decided to include
        a "to do" section that acts almost like a notification center, that let's know students what they should focus
        on for the week. We did completely away with the content in the original
        homepage and put it in the About tab of the navigation bar, which will still include the About content in the
        original website. In place of that, we have included and "announcements" section that will display the "news"
        part from D2L. The Resources tab will same as the original, and we have made other important links, such as
        BCIT and D2L easier to find by including them in the main navigation bar.
        <br><br>&emsp;For the lecture we decided to use a classic dark text on white
        background so it is easier on the eyes. The quiz is also now implemented into the course website, in both the
        home page (under the "to do" section) and in the agenda section of the lecture page. The quiz will have a timer
        that will automatically submit the quiz in a certain amount of time, as well as limitations that prevent
        access to lecture material if it is a closed book quiz.</p>
